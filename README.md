### Tests

Unit tests are ran on each pipeline build. The pipelines are built with `Azure DevOps` from the `azure-pipelines.yml` file

Additionally, there are test result coverage reports done by [Coverlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/dotnet-core?view=azure-devops#collect-code-coverage-metrics-with-coverlet). An example of a pipeline build with unit test coverage report can be found below

The authentication microservice is built to additionally leverage the following libraries:

- [Fluent Validation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation#get-started) for validation
- [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly#polly) for resiliency and transient-fault-handling
